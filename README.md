🎯 Problem Statement

Healthcare centers in India face unpredictable and overwhelming surges in patients during major festivals (like Diwali, Holi), seasonal pollution spikes, and unexpected epidemics. These events strain staffing, deplete medical supplies, and lead to severe overcrowding, compromising the quality and timeliness of patient care. Hospitals are often forced into a reactive, "fire-fighting" mode, leading to staff burnout and suboptimal patient outcomes.

✨ Our Solution: Svasthya AI

Svasthya AI is a proactive, agentic AI system designed to be an intelligent operations partner for hospital administrators. It transforms hospital management from a reactive state of emergency into a calm, data-driven, and forward-looking process.

Our system autonomously ingests and analyzes a wide array of data streams—including public health bulletins, environmental data, festival calendars, and news trends—to generate highly accurate forecasts of patient influx. More importantly, it translates these predictions into a concrete, prioritized, and actionable Operational Readiness Plan, empowering hospitals to prepare effectively.

🚀 Key Features

📈 Predictive Analytics Dashboard: A real-time dashboard showcasing a 7-day patient influx forecast, key metrics like ER capacity, and the predicted types of medical conditions (e.g., respiratory, trauma).

📋 Dynamic Readiness Plan: An automated, timeline-based plan with prioritized actions for the next 72 hours, covering supplies, staffing, and facility management.

🤖 AI-Powered Recommendations: Specific, justified suggestions for staffing adjustments and supply chain orders to prevent shortages and optimize resource allocation.

📢 Automated Communications Hub: A central place to draft and schedule both internal staff alerts and multi-lingual public health advisories to manage patient load at the source.

📊 Multi-Agent Architecture:

Data Weaver: Gathers and synthesizes diverse data streams.
Oracle Engine: Employs ML models to generate forecasts.
Strategic Planner: Translates predictions into actionable plans.
ConnectSphere: Automates and tailors communications.
